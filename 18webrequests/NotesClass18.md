# Class 18: Handling Web Requests in GoLang

## Understanding Web Requests:

1. **Introduction:**
   - Go provides powerful libraries for making HTTP requests, enabling developers to interact with web services, APIs, and fetch data from the internet.

2. **Purpose of Web Requests:**
   - Web requests are crucial for fetching data, consuming APIs, and integrating external services into Go applications.

3. **Key Concepts:**
   - Go's `net/http` package facilitates making HTTP requests, and `ioutil` is used for handling the response body.

4. **Common Use Cases:**
   - Web requests are used for tasks such as fetching data from a remote server, consuming RESTful APIs, or accessing web services.

## Making Web Requests in Go:

5. **HTTP GET Request:**
   - Use `http.Get` to make a simple GET request to a URL. Example:
   ```go
   response, err := http.Get(url)
   ```

6. **Response Handling:**
   - Check for errors in the response and handle them appropriately. Example:
   ```go
   if err != nil {
       panic(err)
   }
   ```

7. **Closing the Response Body:**
   - Always close the response body to avoid resource leaks. Defer ensures proper closure. Example:
   ```go
   defer response.Body.Close()
   ```

8. **Reading Response Body:**
   - Use `ioutil.ReadAll` to read the entire response body. Example:
   ```go
   databytes, err := ioutil.ReadAll(response.Body)
   ```

9. **Converting Bytes to String:**
   - Convert the data bytes to a string for easy handling. Example:
   ```go
   content := string(databytes)
   ```

10. **Displaying Content:**
    - Print or process the content obtained from the web request. Example:
    ```go
    fmt.Println(content)
    ```

11. **Conclusion:**
    - Making web requests in Go is straightforward with the `net/http` package. Understanding how to perform HTTP GET requests, handle responses, and read response bodies is essential for building applications that interact with web services and APIs.
