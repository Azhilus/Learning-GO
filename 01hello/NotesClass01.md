# Notes for Class 1 - Introduction to GoLang

1. **Introduction to GoLang:**
    - Go (or Golang) is a statically-typed, compiled language designed for simplicity, efficiency, and readability. It was developed by Google.

2. **Package Declaration:**
    - `"package main"` indicates that this file is the start of the executable program.

3. **Importing Packages:**
    - The `import` statement is used to include packages that provide functionality beyond the basic language features. Here, `"fmt"` is imported for formatted I/O.

4. **Main Function:**
    - The `func main()` function is the starting point of the program. Execution begins here.

5. **Print Statement:**
    - The `fmt.Println()` function is used to print output to the console. In this case, it prints the famous "Hello, World!" message.

6. **Static Typing:**
    - Go is a statically-typed language, meaning variable types are declared explicitly.

7. **Object-Oriented Features:**
    - Go does not support traditional object-oriented features like class-based inheritance. However, it supports types and methods, making it suitable for both procedural and object-oriented programming.

8. **Emphasis on Simplicity:**
    - Go emphasizes simplicity and readability. It has a garbage collector for automatic memory management.

9. **Concurrent Programming:**
    - Go uses goroutines for concurrent programming, making it efficient for handling concurrent tasks.

10. **Method Overloading:**
    - Unlike many other languages, Go does not support method overloading. However, it supports function overloading by allowing multiple functions with the same name in the same package.

11. **Error Handling:**
    - Go has a unique approach to error handling using multiple return values, where the last return value is often an error.

12. **Compilation:**
    - Go programs are compiled into machine code, resulting in a single binary executable.
