# Notes for Class 2 - Data Types and Variable Declaration in GoLang

1. **Static Typing:**
   - Go is a statically-typed language, requiring explicit declaration of variable types to catch errors at compile time.

2. **Constants in Go:**
   - Constants in Go are declared using the "const" keyword. They must be assigned a value during declaration, and once assigned, their values cannot be changed.

3. **Variables:**
   - Variables are containers for storing data values. They are declared using the "var" keyword, followed by the variable name, the type, and an optional initial value.

4. **Primitive Data Types:**
   - In Go, there are various built-in primitive data types, including strings, booleans, integers, unsigned integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers, bytes, and runes.

5. **Advanced Data Types:**
   - Advanced data types in Go include arrays, slices, maps, structs, and interfaces.

6. **Formatted I/O:**
   - The "fmt" package is used for formatted I/O. The "Println" function is used to print to the console.

7. **Printf and Type Printing:**
   - `Printf` is used for formatted printing. The "%T" verb is used to print the type of a variable.

8. **Type Inference:**
   - Type inference in Go allows you to declare a variable without explicitly specifying its type. The compiler infers the type based on the assigned value.

9. **Short Variable Declaration:**
   - Short variable declaration (`:=`) is a concise way of declaring and initializing variables. It can only be used inside functions.

10. **Fundamental Concepts:**
    - Constants, variables, and data types are fundamental concepts in programming, and understanding them is crucial for writing effective and bug-free code.

11. **Code Example:**
    - The code provided demonstrates the declaration and initialization of variables and constants with various primitive and advanced data types, showcasing Go's syntax and flexibility.
