/*
   Notes for Class 2 - Data Types and Variable Declaration in GoLang:

   1. Go is a statically-typed language, which means that variable types must be declared explicitly.
      This helps catch errors at compile time.

   2. Constants in Go are declared using the "const" keyword. They must be assigned a value during declaration,
      and once assigned, their values cannot be changed.

   3. Variables are containers for storing data values. They are declared using the "var" keyword, followed
      by the variable name, the type, and an optional initial value.

   4. In Go, there are various built-in primitive data types, including strings, booleans, integers, unsigned integers,
      floating-point numbers, complex numbers, bytes, and runes.

   5. Advanced data types in Go include arrays, slices, maps, structs, and interfaces.

   6. The "fmt" package is used for formatted I/O. The "Println" function is used to print to the console.

   7. Printf is used for formatted printing. The "%T" verb is used to print the type of a variable.

   8. Type inference in Go allows you to declare a variable without explicitly specifying its type. The compiler
      infers the type based on the assigned value.

   9. Short variable declaration (:=) is a concise way of declaring and initializing variables. It can only be
      used inside functions.

   10. Constants, variables, and data types are fundamental concepts in programming, and understanding them is
       crucial for writing effective and bug-free code.

   11. The code provided demonstrates the declaration and initialization of variables and constants with
       various primitive and advanced data types, showcasing Go's syntax and flexibility.
